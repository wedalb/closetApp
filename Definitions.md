# Closet App 
## Idea 
this app is supposed to display all your clothes in your closet. 
To do that you can either take a picture of each element or just fill in some information and let the algorithm create an image.
 
## Structure of a clothing item
A clothing piece can have different categories. Of course there are millions of them but to keep them abstract we will reduce them to: tops, bottoms, dresses, shoes, accessoiries, jewelry. 

The color plays a very important role because each different style you choose from to create an outfit has different "accepted" color palettes. 
For example an alternative clothing would mostly go by black, red, blue, vibrant colors or white. 
A business look has a more natural color palette while an artistic look is very colorful and vibrant and barely uses black. 

The size doesn't matter in the algorithm, yet it is there for your information. 

You can give the clothing pieces names like "leoprint top"
